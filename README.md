### Introduction
Online Booking System uses Google Sheets and Google Forms to create an Online Reservation System.
A user is prompted to enter an email address, First and Last name, Class day and time, as well as their seat choice. A Google Script Add-on was created to allow the admin to print the spreadsheet as a PDF so they can also have a hard copy.
